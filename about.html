    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Sameeksha Sharma, a final-year Electrical Engineering student at Shri G.S. Institute of Technology and Science, Indore (Class of 2026). I have a passion for coding and web development, and I'm currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms with Java, along with a comprehensive web development course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Academically, I've secured 92% and 95.6% in my 10th and 12th ICSE board exams, and maintained an 8.4 GPA through my college years. I also have strong communication skills with several medals in literary and oration competitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from academics and coding, I enjoy learning languages like Spanish, and love exploring new technologies including blockchain, React.js, and backend development. I'm eager to apply my skills and grow through real-world software development opportunities.
